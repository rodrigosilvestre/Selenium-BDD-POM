# Selenium with BDD and Page Object Model

This project aims to automate the Tricentis Vehicle Insurance Application page, so that it fills in data in all the Automobile Insurance tabs, using data from the BDD written in Cucumber. The code was written using a design that helps improve test maintenance and reduce code duplication called the Page Object Model.
